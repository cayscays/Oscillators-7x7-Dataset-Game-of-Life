# oscillators-7x7-dataset-game-of-life - ONGOING
A database of the 7x7 [oscillators in Conway's Game of Life](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Oscillator) with a max period of 15 generations and a grid border that goes to infinity.

* ONGOING: I keep on adding new oscillators to the database.

## Usage:
There are two ways to use the data:
1. Access the data directly using the file [dataset_7x7_oscillators.txt](https://github.com/cayscays/oscillators-7x7-dataset-game-of-life/blob/main/dataset_7x7_oscillators.txt). In this file, the oscillators are saved and represented as 0s for dead cells and 1s for alive cells.
2. Use python to access the dataset's API using the file: [oscillators_dataset_api.py](https://github.com/cayscays/oscillators-7x7-dataset-game-of-life/blob/main/oscillators_dataset_api.py).
