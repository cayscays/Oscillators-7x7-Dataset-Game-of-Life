## About Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway. It is characterized by simple rules yet capable of generating intricate and complex behaviors. It consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell evolves over time based on its neighbors' states.
